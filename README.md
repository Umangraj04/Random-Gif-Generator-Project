#Random-Gif-Generator

I made this Project using Reactjs and Tailwind CSS that is Random Gif Genrator.
In this project we have used custom hooks to create a dynamic web application that fetches random GIFs based on user input. 
With just a click of a button, users can enjoy a delightful surprise as the application displays a random GIF fetched from the  API.
Means that there are two options available one who picks the random gif from API and second where you can search any gif with its name.
